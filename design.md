 ✅ **DETAILED MASTER PROMPT FOR THE LEAD-GENERATION BUSINESS IDEA**

**Title: Local Lead-Generation Automation Using Python (Zero-Budget Project)**

**Description:**
I am building a **zero-budget lead-generation business** using Python and free resources. My goal is to collect **publicly available business/customer information**, organize it into high-quality lead lists, and sell these lists to local businesses such as real estate agents, car dealers, tutors, marketers, home-service providers, and other SMEs who need new clients. The project must be legally compliant, use only publicly accessible data, and require no paid tools.

## 🎯 **Objectives**

1. Use Python to gather **publicly available leads** from public listings, business directories, and marketplaces.
2. Clean, filter, and format the collected data into a **professional lead report** (PDF or Excel).
3. Create **three different sellable packages** (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium).
4. Use free platforms (WhatsApp, Facebook, Marketplace, local business groups) to market and sell the reports.
5. Generate a minimum of **R10 000 in the first week** by selling reports at R300–R800 each.
6. Use only a **school PC**, free libraries, and free tools.
